		<h2>About</h2>
			<p>I am a first year MS student in Computational Linguistics at Brandeis University where my interests are Natural Language Processing.
			<br>
			 I received my BA in Linguistics from UC Santa Cruz. After graduating, I spent several years at Google, working on their Localization team. Most recently, I had been working as an analyst and engineer at a data startup specializing in location signal insights.
