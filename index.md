## about

I'm a computational linguist, currently working at [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/about-us/contact/) in their natural language understanding group. 

My work is primarily in computational and machine learning orientated  approaches to questions involving natural language semantics. I'm also interested in questions of data collection methodology, annotation and bias within the context of machine learning.

I received my M.S. in [Computational Linguistics](http://www.brandeis.edu/computer-science/computational-linguistics/graduate/masters/index.html) at Brandeis and my B.A. in [Linguistics](https://linguistics.ucsc.edu/) from the University of California, Santa Cruz. While at Brandeis, I founded and co-organized the [Ethics in NLP reading group](https://ethicsatbrandeis.github.io/). In between my undergraduate and graduate degrees, I was working in the San Francisco Bay Area, first at Google on their localization team and later at a [data startup](https://www.emodoinc.com/our-story/) which was acquired by [Ericsson's](https://www.ericsson.com/en) Innovation Lab. During the course of my masters I had the opportunity to intern at [Basis Technology](https://www.basistech.com/) and at [Charles River Analytics](https://www.cra.com/technical-expertise/natural-language-processing).

My resume is available [here](https://sheetskristen.github.io/resume/index.html).
