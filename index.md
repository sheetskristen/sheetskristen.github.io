## about

I am a graduate student in [Computational Linguistics](http://www.brandeis.edu/computer-science/computational-linguistics/graduate/masters/index.html) and research assistant at Brandeis University. I founded and co-organize Brandeis's [Ethics in NLP reading group](https://ethicsatbrandeis.github.io/). I'm interested in computational and data-driven approaches to questions in linguistics.

I received my B.A. in [Linguistics](https://linguistics.ucsc.edu/) from the University of California, Santa Cruz. After graduating, I spent several years at Google, working on their localization team. Before starting at Brandeis, I had been working as an analyst and engineer at a [data startup](https://www.emodoinc.com/our-story/) specializing in location signal insights which was acquired by Ericsson's Innovation Lab. Between the first and second years of my masters, I interned at [Basis Technology](https://www.basistech.com/), working on their [Rosette](https://www.basistech.com/text-analytics/rosette/) platform. I'm passionate about ethics, accountability and equitity in techonology and frequently speak on this topic. 

My resume as a PDF is available [here](https://github.com/sheetskristen/sheetskristen.github.io/blob/master/files/Kristen%20Sheets%20-%20Resume.pdf).

## projects 

| Project  |  Year |
|------|-------|
|**Named Entity Recognition for Podcasts** (with [Elena Álvarez Mellado](https://lirondos.github.io/), Julian Fernandez and Linxuan Yang), *Brandeis University* <br> Developing a custom ontology, building from the OntoNotes NER annotation guidelines for named entity recognition and extraction from podcast transcripts. Future work to include topic modeling using extracted named entities.| ongoing |
|**Basic Semantic Types Classifier**, *Brandeis University* <br>Using the WordNet annotated SemCor corpus, I designed, training a classification model to identify a word’s CoreLex basic semantic type, as a proof of concept for the task identifying trends in polysemy. I’m currently expanding on this work, building a neural model using contextual word embeddings (BERT). | ongoing |
|**Temporal Annotation of Economic News** (with Jingdi Shen and Keren Sun), *Brandeis University* <br>Developed custom annotation guidelines for use in temporal relation annotation of recent corpus of economic news, specifically looking to relate time expressions with events and events in relation to one another. | 2019 |
| **Classifying the Alt-Right** (with Samuel Haymann), *Brandeis University* <br> Created an annotated corpus of far-right and alt-right tweets and trained Naive Bayes classifier to identify far-right Twitter content. | 2018  |
