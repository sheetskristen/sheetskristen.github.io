## about

I am a graduate student in [Computational Linguistics](http://www.brandeis.edu/computer-science/computational-linguistics/graduate/masters/index.html) and research assistant at Brandeis University. I founded and organize Brandeis's Ethics in NLP reading group. 

I received my B.A. in [Linguistics](https://linguistics.ucsc.edu/) from the University of California, Santa Cruz. After graduating, I spent several years at Google, working on their localization team. Most recently, I had been working as an analyst and engineer at a [data startup](https://www.emodoinc.com/our-story/) specializing in location signal insights which was acquired by Ericsson's Innovation Lab.
