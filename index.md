## About

I am a graduate student in [Computational Linguistics](http://www.brandeis.edu/computer-science/computational-linguistics/graduate/masters/index.html) and research assistant in the Lab for Linguistics and Computation at Brandeis University. During the winter and spring of 2020, I'll be interning at [Charles River Analytics](https://www.cra.com/technical-expertise/natural-language-processing), working in their Computational Linguistics research group.

My research is primarily in computational and data-driven approaches to questions in natural language semantics. I'm also concerned with questions of data collection methodology, annotation and bias within the context of machine learning. I founded and co-organize Brandeis’s [Ethics in NLP reading group](https://ethicsatbrandeis.github.io/) and am passionate about equity in technology, frequently speaking on this topic.

I received my B.A. in [Linguistics](https://linguistics.ucsc.edu/) from the University of California, Santa Cruz. After graduating, I spent several years at Google, working on their localization team. Before starting at Brandeis, I had been working as an analyst and engineer at a [data startup](https://www.emodoinc.com/our-story/) specializing in location signal insights which was acquired by Ericsson's Innovation Lab. Between the first and second years of my master's, I interned at [Basis Technology](https://www.basistech.com/), working on their [Rosette](https://www.basistech.com/text-analytics/rosette/) platform.

My resume is available [here](https://sheetskristen.github.io/resume/index.html).

## NLP Projects 

| Project  |  Year |
|------|-------|
|**Basic Semantic Types Classifier** <br>supervised by Marc Verhagen and James Pustejovsky, *Brandeis University* <br>Using the WordNet annotated SemCor corpus, I designed and trained a  Bayesian classification model to identify a word’s CoreLex basic semantic type, as a proof of concept for the task identifying trends in polysemy. I’m currently expanding on this work, building a neural model using contextual word embeddings (BERT). | ongoing |
|**NLP Tools** <br> Implemented from scratch: a logistic regression classifier, a perceptron model, a Naive Bayes text classifier and a HMM part-of-speech tagger (Python) <br> Designed my own data structures including LinkedLists, Queues, Stacks, Splay trees, HashTables and Heaps (Java)| ongoing|
