## About

I am a first year MS student in Computational Linguistics at Brandeis University where my interests are Natural Language Processing.

I received my BA in Linguistics from UC Santa Cruz. After graduating, I spent several years at Google, working on their Localization team. Most recently, I had been working as an analyst and engineer at a data 'startup' specializing in location signal insights within Ericsson's Innovation Lab.
