## about

I am a first year MS student in Computational Linguistics at Brandeis University.

I received my BA in Linguistics from UC Santa Cruz. After graduating, I spent several years at Google, working on their localization team. Most recently, I had been working as an analyst and engineer at a data startup specializing in location signal insights acquired by  Ericsson's Innovation Lab.
